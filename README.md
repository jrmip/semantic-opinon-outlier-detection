# Semantic and opinion features for outlier detection in textual data
The version of python that has been used is Python 3.8 but previous versions can be used with respect to requirements.
For running default setup presented in the article you can use the following commands:

```shell
make requirements
make features
make experiments
```

For cleaning all repository, the command `make clean` can be used.

*Note: We propose to use wrapper of sklearn, nltk and ml_datasets in order to facilitate the access to data. Also, the complete run can take 1 to few hours.*
